This paper examines the historical trade-off between risk and return in FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) compared to SP500 in the period 2014-2019. 
Classic finance theory suggest that investors should not choose to hold a portfolio that is more volatile unless they expect to each a higher return. 
In this paper we illustrate the historical relationship between volatility and average returns and assess whether active stock-picking would have been beneficial over the last five years. The reason for choosing FAANG is that they are the five most popular tech stocks for active stock picking. SP500 has a market cap of between 70 and 80 pct. of the total U.S. stock market and is therefore a good indicator of the overall direction of the market for passive investors.
