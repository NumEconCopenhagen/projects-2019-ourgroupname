# Modelproject

This project analyses the effects on capital and savings by introducing taxes in the overlapping generations model. The model is solved with both a root-seaking algorithm (with and without taxes) and a gauss-seidel algorithm (with taxes). 
Furthermore, by using an ARC (aggregate resource constraint) we ensure that all resources in the model are allocated. 
We find that capital stock decreases such that savings must decrease as well. Hence, the introduction of the labour and capital tax is likely to harm both the current and future generations.
